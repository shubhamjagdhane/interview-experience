NOTE: This is a continuation of Q1, so please try to reuse as much as possible.

Consider a network of cities connected by roads. You can travel from a city to another, if there exists a road between them in either direction. You can assume that a pair of cities are connected by a maximum of one road.

A vehicle can be used to travel from one city to another, but it has a limited fuel tank size. Some of the cities have a petrol pump, where the vehicle can be refuelled fully. Let us assume that the distance the vehicle can cover on a full tank is called the capacity of the vehicle.

Q2 - Find the paths such that the vehicle can complete the journey between a given pair of cities without running out of fuel.

Sample Input 1:
5
DELHI 0
MUMBAI 0
CHENNAI 1
PUNE 0
KOLKATA 0
5
DELHI MUMBAI 10
MUMBAI CHENNAI 12

DELHI PUNE
25

Input Explanation:
Input (Line 1): Number of cities
5

Input (Line 2-6): City name followed by 1 if it has a petrol pump or 0 if it doesnâ€™t, separated by spaces.
DELHI 0
.
.

Input (Line 7): Number of roads
5

Input (Line 8-12): Each line (5 of them, because road inputs were 5) consist of two cities followed by the distance between them separated by a space
DELHI MUMBAI 10

Input (Line 13): Two cities between which you want to find the paths
DELHI PUNE

Input (Line 14): Capacity (distance the vehicle can cover on a full tank) of the vehicle
25
